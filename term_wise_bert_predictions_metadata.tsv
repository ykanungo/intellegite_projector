Fall 2015	Do a research project, not a development project.If you’re like me, you can probably do a development project on your own.A first-time research project is harder to do without the guidance available in the class.I did a development project because it was more predictable and I’m kicking myself now, although I still learned a lot (e.g., searching the literature and writing a conference paper) that will be useful if/when I do pursue research.	0.13889903850335014

Spring 2018	Stay on task every week! It helps if you have an idea for a project but it's OK not to in week 1. The first weeks of the course felt rather intense for me with all the research, writing and some stressing over trying to select a project topic. Select the areas and topics you are genuinely interested in and the writing assignments will be enjoyable and the ideas will come!	0.07379542954703505

Spring 2018	"The course excellent in terms of DIY. You have lot of options. I personally would advice fellow colleagues to work as team. In OMSCS, there are limited opportunities to interact with your peers. EDTECH course does awesome in providing opportunity to work as team. Also along with previous semester project search tool also use tools such as """"google scholar"""", """"IEEEieeexplore"""", etc. to finalize your projects."	0.06416904677105738

Spring 2018	Try to work ahead on projects when time commitments are low outside of school. Start early on the SIGCHI formatting of the papers. I started doing this with Assignment 3 and it made each subsequent assignment easier with the format and did not have to stress about the final paper format.	0.06961133378835004

Spring 2018	When you decide to register for this course, you should really start thinking about the type of project you want to do. Read ahead about the different types of projects you can do (Research, Content, or tool creation) and come in with an idea. This will put you ahead when you are going through the first few weeks of the course and set you up for success throughout the course.	0.08766424379110052
Spring 2018	Work hard to lock down your project early. That'll make the rest of the class easier, since you'll be able to use the assignments to help with the final paper.	0.09629190953963455
Spring 2018	You will be spending almost the entire semester on working on your project,so might as well utilize that time to develop something that can contribute to your growth.Try to choose a project that makes you feel challenged . It can be really tempting to choose an easy project to work on due to the nature of this course,but that would not contribute to your learning experience for OMSCS. If you want to learn and gain something out of this course,try to explore ideas on topics or skills that can help you.	0.046190705493718565
Summer 2018	- Take this class in a full term, not in a summer term - Whatever track you choose (research, development, content) make sure you're already confident with the required tools and knowledge to perform what you'd like to do; you won't have the time to lear	0.09440344989739612
Summer 2018	1) Keep the idea of the presentation in mind. When you are looking through all the papers pay attention to the pictures and what one's might come in handy an save them. 2) SIGCHI format is really efficient. 3) Beware changing directions. If you do you early papers will be much less useful on the later ones and you will end up doing a LOT more work. 4) You can redo your work, so take chances and try out ways you think you should do things. 5) I'm not sure of this because I haven't gotten my final grade, but if I had to do it over, I would work more on assembling the overall vision of what I'm doing, the theory behind it and the outline of the program, instead of actually creating the fine details.I would have tried to develop and test the concepts behind my project instead of working on an extensive and low level application of them.	0.06974636852983696
Summer 2018	Don't underestimate the amount of time it takes to create a final video presentation and written paper. I easily spent a combined 15 hours on the two. Try to write the paper 2-3 weeks before it's due. Use that rough draft to guide the last few weeks of your project, then revise the paper in the last week.	0.07869548231142717

Summer 2018	Before taking this course it'll be important to set up your own expectations based on the time you're able to put into it. Also, when the time comes to choose the topic for your final project, you should work on something you're really interested in learning more so that way you get to meet your own expectations and potentially contribute something you feel proud of.	0.0502179016431451
Summer 2018	Begin reading articles early and thinking about your project. If you go with the research route, then narrow down your topic of interest a lot and get started sooner rather than later. Then, narrow down the topic even more. The class will fly-by, and getting the research steps completed requires a lot more time then you would expect in order to gather enough experimental data for your final. Outside of that, have some fun and learn something from the experience. It's been one of the best class experiences that I've ever had and I'm glad that I took this course as it's confirmed my interest in doing research and experiments.	0.09001052788115602

Fall 2018	But, to answer the question- I'd say to new students to focus on a few topics of interest and the sooner you can make a choice, the better off you'll be. The project is time consuming and spending any time focusing on other things will hurt you. Also, have a very narrow focus for the project. If you have more time at the end, you can implement stretch goals, but don't over reach in the beginning.	0.07336037912781233
Fall 2018	I saw someone say this on OMSCentral... if you're working on an individual research project, you will be isolated, especially if other students don't already understand what you're doing. That was my experience. There was no one available to provide me any technical guidance or feedback. It was really disappointing.	0.10877788904980072
Fall 2018	I think I would recommend getting acquainted with your mentor very early on. I would go beyond introducing yourself and maybe talk about some of your interests. I think it is very important to start to get the creative juices for your project going as early as possible because the feedback you will receive for beginning assignments will be valuable.	0.0624878720155363

Fall 2018	The best advice I can give is to plan and start early. I have been consistently following that which has helped me to deliver on time. The complexity of the course is totally dependent on the project work we choose. To make it fun or boring is all in the students hand. So while choosing a project which is motivated by personal reasons will keep you engaged and motivated. In my case, I built a solution to work around the anxiety of giving mobile devices to my child who is in kindergarten. Since it is a tool which will benefit me and my child, i could involve him as well in my project development for testing, which made it all fun.	0.054759406267596254
Fall 2018	The best advice I can give is to practice good time management especially if you're working full time, wrangling kids, etc. Do not push everything to the weekend. Working until 8am on Monday is not a good idea. Finish your peer reviews as soon as they're up and immediately start your next paper. By starting early, you'll have some time to improve their quality. That effort will payoff for both the proposal and final project, so don't phone them in. Your TA and peers will also appreciate the effort. It's a lot easier to comment on the good papers than the bad ones. And finally, make sure to follow Piazza and contribute something useful when you can, participation is a good portion of the grade and you might find it helps to keep pace with the course. You may even find some teammates if you aren't planning to go solo.	0.0524560145501766

Spring 2019	Although I read the syllabus, I didn't comprehend the part about resubmitting assignments until after the first 5 assignments. In other classes I've taken, re-submissions is only intended for grading screw-ups and is largely discouraged, so I didn't grasp that resubmission is standard practice in this class until I had already accepted Bs for a handful of assignments. My advice to the next wave of students is to resubmit EVERY assignment on which you score less than a 9.	0.08336434143460915

Spring 2019	I feel those in development and programming may be biased towards choosing development track. Given another chance I would go for a content track project.

Spring 2019	If you choose to do the development track alone, find someone (besides your mentor) to help with project management. The task list I submitted to my mentor was too broad and started to lose meaning as I wound up getting in the weeds on things. So he was seeing that i was slipping behind a little bit, but I was aware of all sorts of things not identified in the task list that I needed to do. And as so often happens to me, I started focusing on the trees and totally lost sight of the forest. I wasn't even glancing at my schedule the last couple weeks, which put me in a bad situation, as I managed to convince myself I had a week longer than I really did.; This is a fairly common problem for me, and one could certainly ask how I've made it almost to age 50 without being able to deal with this sort of thing, but the fact is, I'm not the most well-organized person in the world. If I were doing this over again, I would team up with the most well-organized person in the world. It would probably still be just as exhausting, but at least I wouldn't have panic attacks.	0.05322392691713481
Spring 2019	If you do not think your mentor is performing at the level they should, do not wait to involve the head TA or professor.

Spring 2019	Manage and track all of your tasks with tools such as GitHub Issues, Milestones, etc. Various Kanban boards are effective as well. Treat all of the project work as if it is bound to weekly sprints. Icebox nice-to-have features from the get-go so that your project is feasibly scoped. You may end up having time for some of those features, but always prefer underselling to overselling. If following the development track, start by building amenities like continuous integration if applicable. Buying yourself time in the future is critical, because inevitably the work will pile on and take longer than you anticipate.; Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.	0.046259214113556525

Spring 2019	The first few weeks are rigorous, and make sure you find out what your mentor is looking for in your submissions as the rubric doesn 't appear to be as equally applied across different mentors for each assignment.	0.0736611013289482
Spring 2019	The mentor should provide assistance on finalizing the topic for our final project. Also, assisting the materials, the software's required to complete the project. Personally, I ended up spending a lot of time to find out the right software then I came to know few licensed software's were available within Georgia tech for students. But that was too late and no information from my TA regarding the available tools until the end of my final paper. Also, no encouragement as he is also not familiar with my project determination. So, having a knowledgeable SME TA's will definitely help for future students.	0.0654057508669027
Spring 2019	The peer feedbacks act as the most immediate input you'll get to your homework and final project but take these responses with a grain of salt. Rather than awaiting your own feedback, seeing how others followed the same instructions should give you a better idea of whether you're on the right path. Keep it moving, and get as far ahead as you can on a given week. Expect to put several hours into this course each week. It took me, on average, between 12-14 hours but I imagine others can get away with a little over half of that. If you pursue a challenging enough development (app) project I could see this class taking 20 hours weekly.	0.07633636282175059

Spring 2019	Try to decide very early on (even before the start of the course!) at least a broad idea of the type of project you want to work on.  Even waiting until the proposal is due doesn't give as much time as you'd want to develop a project.  Lastly, manage your own expectations carefully when writing your proposal, don't attempt to much.	0.05761307040207777

Summer 2019	* Break down the project tasks into very small chunks; overestimate the time for each (I was worried I would get called out for allocating too much time; I should've started slower); * Collaborate with others; * Ask for input from peers on Piazza and Slack; don't rely solely on your own mentor, especially since peers may be doing similar project and know of useful resources	0.08723701765608897

Summer 2019	Be very careful about the scope of your project. My goals were ambitious, and while I delivered what I believe met the requirements of the course, I did not achieve my personal goals with respect to the performance of my AI models.

Summer 2019	I spent more time than 90% of the people in the class, and produce a product better than 90% of the people in this class (as reflected in the final product and the final 7 reviews from peers). But I will probably end up with a B in the class because: 1) the demanding, and unhelpful peer review system and 2) the subjectivity and whims of mentor grading and the silly rubric you all use (make sure you use a power-point in your final presentation and meet page requirements--have you all even seen senior researchers present?). I knew I probably would be penalized for actually taking on an ambitious project and trying to actually learn things as compared to those who did a couple of surveys, created some course material or wire-frames but jumped through the hoops to get the A. It was a choice I made; but it was still unfair nonetheless.	0.07028672261209881

Summer 2019	If you don't know what you want to work on, spend the first few weeks researching topics that you may be interested in.

Lastly, take the time to really carve out the various tasks in your project proposal as it makes the rest of the semester a lot easier to navigate.	0.07260816023938617

Summer 2019	Overestimate how long tasks will take for the final project! Like,way overestimate! It's way better to finish early and be able to do more than to be running behind and trying to cram things in at the end.
